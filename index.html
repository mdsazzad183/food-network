            <p id="beside">
                This is my first assignment on basic html and css.Before doing this course, I only knew a little bit about HTML. When I created a website with HTML at HSC, I thought that I can now create everyone's website and people will use the website I created. After coming to this course  I realized that the website I created at HSC was like a bucket of water from a huge ocean.
