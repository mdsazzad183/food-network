                This is my first assignment on basic html and css.Before doing this course, I only knew a little bit about HTML. When I created a website with HTML at HSC, I thought that I can now create everyone's website and people will use the website I created. After coming to this course  I realized that the website I created at HSC was like a bucket of water from a huge ocean.

                This chicken, rice, and broccoli foil pack is a complete dinner that’s packed with protein and nutrition. For the greens, I used broccoli but zucchini, green beans, or asparagus will also work.For the rice, I used instant brown rice but white works as well.

                Boneless skinless chicken breasts: Because you are stuffing the chicken, it’s far better to use boneless. You could exchange the breast for boneless thighs, but they aren’t very easy to stuff.Extra virgin olive oil: Just a little bit of oil is all you need.
